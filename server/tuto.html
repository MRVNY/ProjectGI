    <ul>
        <li>The experiment is quite simple. For each trial, we ask you to execute 
            <a id="t1"></a>on a target object. The target object is a circle displayed on the screen. The 
            <a id="t2"></a>displayed on the bottom of the screen. Once the 
            <a id="t3"></a>been correctly performed, the “Next” button will turn deep green. You can then click on this button to start the next trial. 
        <br><br>
        It will need about 5-10 minutes to finish all the levels.We ask you to perform the task as fast and accurately as possible. If you need a little break, you can take it just before clicking on the “Next” button (i.e. when the color of the button is deep green). </li>
        <br>
        <li>Nota bene : some shortcuts might be a problem depending on your navigator and OS, but you will be told and be able to continue the experiment normally in case that happens.</li>
