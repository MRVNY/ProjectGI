# Intro 
Hello, thank you for participating in our experiment on keyboard and gestural interactions. 

We estimate that the complete test will need about 5 minutes to finish. Please make sure you are in a conformable and concentrated state in order to provide the most accurate results of yourself.

# Device
In order to fine tunes our experiment to your device, please answer these questions
* Touchpad / mouse
* QWERTY / AZERTY
* (Windows / Mac ?)

# Tuto (should be different for each type of experiment)
The advancement of this experiment is quite simple. On each level, a task will be shown on the lower part of the screen, once the instruction is shown,  the timer will start, you are required to finish the task as fast as possible. Upon finishing the task, the timer will record the time you spend executing the task, and the "Next" button will turn green, allowing you to pass to the next level. 

If you absolutely need a little pause, we recommend you to do it after the "Next" button turns green in order to not have your rest time recorded in our database.

## ONEKEY
Move the mouse cursor to the circle and click on the circle, then, press on the keys required in the instruction, when the instruction is correctly executed, the "Next" button will turn green

## TWOKEY
Move the mouse cursor to the circle and click on the circle, press on the keys required in the first instruction, if correctly executed, the "Next" button will turn light green, then press on the keys required in the second instruction, if correctly executed, the "Next" button will turn green

## ONEDIR
Move the mouse cursor to the circle, click on the circle and drag it towards the required direction, when the instruction is correctly executed, the "Next" button will turn green

## TWODIR
Move the mouse cursor to the circle, click on the circle and drag it towards the first required direction, if correctly executed, the "Next" button will turn light green, do the same thing with the second instruction, if correctly executed, the "Next" button will turn green

## TWODIRONEDRAW
